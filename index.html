                  <h4>I'm a software developer based in NYC.</h4>
                  <p>I graduated Class of 2020 from Fordham University, with a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics and a Minor in Bioinformatics. I always had a curiosity for the sciences and technology. Following these interests as I progressed my education led me to the field of computer science and I discovered that I enjoyed problem solving through code. My experiences in under-grad have informed my passion for helping others and my eventual goal of working on an M.S. in computational biology. As tech continues to change and evolve it is more important than ever, I feel, to be ethical and do no harm.</p>

                      <p>My quarantine hobby is cross stitching, both needle work and design creation. However, I found that existing cross stitch patterning software was either expensive or not very good. I want to make the hobby that I love more accessable, so have started this open source project. Built with Python for flexiblity, it is a WIP.</p>

                      <p>Smart Flights is a project designed to make finding the least expensive airfare easier, based on a hub and spoke model of flying. It used the Skyscanner API to find the lowest total cost series of flights between continents. This was a team hackathon project for StudentHackV in Manchester, England.</p>

                      <h3>Alexa Skills</h3>
                      <p>I created two Amazon Alexa skills as humorous novelty projects. The first gave trivia facts and the second chastised the user for not getting out of bed. The goal was to learn more about creating and deploying cloud-based applications. I implemented Amazon Web Services in the creation of these skills. I was happy that they gained a modest user base on the Alexa skill store.</p>

                      <p>Get Bazaar is a progressive web app for proximity marketing. Users are able to receive coupons and announcements when their GPS location is in range of an enrolled local business. This project was made for my most recent hackathon, HackCooper in New York City. Our team placed First Runner Up in the overall competition and won the best use of a payment API. it is one of my proudest accomplishments.</p>

                    <h2>Work</h2>
                    <p>While in college, I worked on a freelance web-design project for a landscaping business based in New Jersey. I collaborated remotely from Florida over the course of two weeks to design the project from scratch and trouble shoot with the client to reach their goal of increasing their web presence. I was excited to be able to implement someone else’s vision gain more real world experience solving problems with my education.</p>

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>Outside of coding there are many things I enjoy doing to keep myself occupied, especially as of recently. One of my oldest hobbies is coin collecting. I started when I was young with the state quarters and now I have quite a large collection, including currency I picked up from a trip to Europe. I enjoy planning and going on such trips, though I haven't had the chance to in 2020. Playing piano is another passion of mine. I have recently been learning to play Chopin's Nocturne Op. 9 No. 1, which has been both very challenging and rewarding for me. I have recently learned how to can fruit at home, a skill which I plan to make use of for future holiday gifts. I also enjoy cross stitching, as well as creating my own patterns for such projects.</p>
