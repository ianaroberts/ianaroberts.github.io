                  <h4>I'm a software developer based in NYC.</h4>
                  <p>I graduated class of 2020 from Fordham University, with a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor in Bioinformatics. Growing up I moved all around the country, seeing many different places and meeting people from allover and I've always had a curiosity for the sciences and technology. All this has informed my passion for helping others and my eventual goal of working on an M.S. in computational biology. As tech continues to change and evolve it is more important than ever, I feel, to be ethical and do no harm.</p>

                      <p>Strainer is a chrome extension that was designed to act as a webfilter. It uses jquery to match words on a site to a blacklist and then renders the parent container invisible. I never finished it, but as my first hackathon project it holds a special place for me.</p>

                      <p>These Alexa skills were made as novelty because I think Alexa's dead pan is funny and Amazon was giving away an Echo if you published two. I quickly learned to implement Amazon's services in the creation of skill that gained a modest user base.</p>

                      <p>This project was made for my most recent hackathon, Hack Cooper in New York City. Get Bazaar was a proximity marketing progressive web app. As the user moved into the proximity of a local buisness, they would be able to cupons and announcements from enrolled clients. It placed fourth overall in the competition.</p>

                    <p>While in college I've worked on a couple freelance projects for people I knew. The largest of these was a website for a friend's father's landscaping buisness. I worked remotely over the couse of a couple weeks to design the project from scratch and trouble shoot with the client to reach their goal. I'm excited to gain more real world experiance solving problems with my education.</p>

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>Outside of coding there are many things I enjoy doing to keep myself occupiecd, especially as of recently. One of my oldest hobbies is coin collecting. I started when I was young with the state quarters and other forign and domestic coins I thought were interesting. Today I have quite a large collection, including currency I picked up from a trip to Europe. I enjoy planning and going on such trips, though I haven't had the chance to in 2020. Playing piano is another passion of mine. I have recently been learning to play Chopin's Nocturne Op. 9 No. 1, which has been both very challenging and rewarding for me. I have also learned how to can fruit at home, a skill which I plan to make use of for future holiday gifts.</p>
