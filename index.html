                  <h1>Hello, my name is Vivian Roberts.</h1>
                  <h4>I'm a software developer based in NYC.</h4>
                  <p>I graduated Class of 2020 from Fordham University, with a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics and a Minor in Bioinformatics. Growing up I moved all around the country, seeing many different places and meeting people from all over. I've always had a curiosity for the sciences and technology. My experiances have informed my passion for helping others and my eventual goal of working on an M.S. in computational biology. As tech continues to change and evolve it is more important than ever, I feel, to be ethical and do no harm.</p>

                      <p>Strainer is a Chrome extension that I designed to act as a web filter at hackRPI. It uses jquery to match words on a site to a word blacklist and then renders the parent container invisible. But it remains work in progress, but as my first hackathon project it holds a special place for me.</p>

                      <h3>Smart Flights</h3>
                      <p>Smart Flights was a project designed to make finding the least expensive airfare easier. This project was based on a hub and spoke model of flying. It used the Skyscanner API to find the lowest total cost series of flights between continents. This was a collaborative project for StudentHackV in Manchester, England.</p>

                      <p>I created two Amazon Alexa skills as humorous novelty projects. The goal was to learn more about creating and deploying cloud based applications. I implemented Amazon Web Services in the creation of skills that gained a modest user base.</p>

                      <h3>Get Bazaar</h3>
                      <p>Get Bazaar was a progressive web app for proximity marketing. When the user's GPS location was in range of an enrolled local business, they would be able to receive coupons and announcements. This project was made for my most recent hackathon, HackCooper in New York City. Our team placed fourth overall in the competition and it is one of my proudest accomplishments.</p>

                    <h2>Work</h2>
                    <p>While in college, I've worked on a couple freelance projects for people I knew. The largest of these was a website for a friend's father's landscaping business. I worked remotely over the course of a couple weeks to design the project from scratch and trouble shoot with the client to reach their goal. I'm excited to gain more real world experience solving problems with my education.</p>

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>Outside of coding there are many things I enjoy doing to keep myself occupied, especially as of recently. One of my oldest hobbies is coin collecting. I started when I was young with the state quarters and now I have quite a large collection, including currency I picked up from a trip to Europe. I enjoy planning and going on such trips, though I haven't had the chance to in 2020. Playing piano is another passion of mine. I have recently been learning to play Chopin's Nocturne Op. 9 No. 1, which has been both very challenging and rewarding for me. I have recently learned how to can fruit at home, a skill which I plan to make use of for future holiday gifts. I also enjoy cross stiching, as well as creating my own patterns for such projects.</p>
